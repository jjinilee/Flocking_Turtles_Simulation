# Flocking_turtles

This project is to design and implement a flocking simulation in Java, where each turtle will move around in random direction on the screen and interact with others to move in flocking behaviour by following a set of 3 main behaviours, of which the parameters can be varied by user. The 3 main behaviours are cohesion, separation, and alignment.
